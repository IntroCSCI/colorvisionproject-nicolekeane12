# Color Transparecny

## Description

 I wanted my program to open a file and examine the transparecny number, and decide if that color may or may not be problematic to color blind people. I wanted it to read the file, after the third comma, and analyze that number and ouput if the color might or might not be a problem.

Here is an example of the program running:

## C++ Guide

### Variables and Data Types

I used double to represent the decimal that will hold the transparecny number. The string filename will help the user open the file "colors" I used the string input to count and find the commas in the file.

### Console Input and Output

I will input the file name "colors" it is supposed to examine the last number and then output the phrase This color is unlikely/ likely to be probelmatic based on transparency.

### Decisions

I used an If statment, and another if statment, one to see if the file was open and another one to count to the right amount of places within the file.

### Iteration

I use an if and an else if, for the user to do something if the statment is true and to move on if it is not.

### File Input and Output

I input the filename, and it should read it an output the correct reposne.
